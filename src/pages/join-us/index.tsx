          WorkHack is building on the frontiers of generative AI. We are looking for folks who are as excited as we are about building
          products with high impact on human productivity and business outcomes. 
          <br/><br/>
          Weâ€™re well capitalised to compete in an exciting large
          market. 
          <br/><br/>
          Starting with conversations as a medium, WH wants to be the product layer between Large Language Models and commercial
          applications making it easier for companies to utilise the generative AI capabilities by building goal-driven safe abstractions.
          <br/><br/>
          Weâ€™ve processed over 2 million users for our customersâ€” being one of the first companies to put a Large Language Model for a
          complex end-user deployment. We are inventing newer applications of AI beyond code generation and copywriting. 
          <br/><br/>
          During all this,
          weâ€™ve remained extremely lean. For most of our lifetime, weâ€™ve functioned with 5 full-time teammates, and recently expanded to 10.
          Now growing to 15.
